# Segment-slender-regions
This repository contains an algorithm to segment slender regions in 3D microstructures

Two sample microstructures are included namely: FOAM_MICROSTRUCTURE.mat and IWP_MICROSTRUCTURE.mat
Please run the MATLAB file named Main_file.m
The required matlab functions to the Main_file are included.

Tips: Studying FOAM_MICROSTRUCTURE is resource intensive. If the user wishes to apply the algorithm and has limited computational resources, please use IWP_MICROSTRUCTURE.
